The purpose of multisig wallets is to increase security by requiring multiple parties to agree on transactions before execution. Transactions can be executed only when confirmed by a predefined number of owners. A web user interface can be found [here](/dapp).

**NOTE:** Not compatible with current NodeJS LTS. Recommended NodeJS version is v6.17.1 (last LTS for v6).

Features
-------------

- Can hold Ether and all kind of tokens with multisig support
- Easy to use offline signing (cold wallet) support
- Integration with web3 wallets (Metamask, Mist, Parity, etc)
- Transaction data and log decoding, makes transactions more readable
- Interacting with any contracts with UI support
- Hardware wallet support (Ledger Wallet)
- Optional email notifications when an event is triggered or you are required to sign a transaction

Install dependencies
--------------------
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

[NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script): 
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash
```

`command -v nvm` should output nvm, but if there is no output or `command not found`, then restart the terminal.


[Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle#install): `npm install -g truffle`

Install
-------------
```
# For Ubuntu/Debian you need to install libusb development headers
apt install -y libusb-1.0-0-dev

git clone https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet.git
cd MultiSigWallet

# Latest NodeJS (v12.13.0) does NOT appear to work correctly.
# You should use NVM and install Node v6.17.1 for best results: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
# Tested by @Privex on 2019-Nov-06 with v6.17.1 with success
nvm install v6.17.1

# node-gyp is required for 'npm install' to work correctly
npm install node-gyp

npm install
```

Test
-------------
### Run contract tests:
```
npm test
```
### Run interface tests:
```
npm run test-dapp
```

Deploy Contracts
-------------
### Deploy multisig wallet:
```
truffle migrate <account1,account2,...,accountN> <requiredConfirmations>
```
### Deploy multisig wallet with daily limit:
```
truffle migrate <account1,account2,...,accountN> <requiredConfirmations> <dailyLimit>
```

FAQ
-------------
### How to set a custom Ethereum Node?
You can specify a custom Ethereum Node endpoint by going to `settings` page. Click on `Ethereum Node` dropdown menu and select `Custom configuration`, this would make the Ethereum node's field editable. Please write your new endpoint there. Remember, if `Web3 Provider` is set to `Default (Metamask, Mist, Parity)`, Multisig will use the Ethereum Node endpoint coming with the Web3 Provider, so in that case go to your injected Web3 Provider (Metamask for instance) and update/switch your Ethereum Node endpoint.

### I've imported a Multisig address or a contract address into address book but it gets detected as a EOA
Make sure you're connected to the same network your Multisig/contract was created on, if you created it on Mainnet, you should then connect to Mainnet in order to let the system detect its type correctly.
